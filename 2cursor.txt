Video Editing Application: Detailed Feature Overview
App Purpose
This web-based video editing application allows users to:
Upload a video.

Segment multiple objects interactively using prompt points.

Track segmented objects across all frames.

Apply and customize visual effects to segmented regions.

Export the results as mask videos or a fully effected video.
The app operates in two distinct modes—Segmentation Mode and FX Mode—with a seamless workflow between them, providing an intuitive and powerful editing experience.
Core Modes and Workflow
The application features two primary modes:
Segmentation Mode: For uploading videos, segmenting objects, tracking them, and managing segmented objects.

FX Mode: For applying and customizing visual effects on segmented objects and exporting the final output.
Users can switch between modes using dedicated buttons: "FX Mode" (from Segmentation Mode) and "Seg Mode" (from FX Mode).

The video frame remains visible in both modes, with segmentations overlaid as applicable.
1. Segmentation Mode
1.1 Video Upload and Display
Upload: Users upload a video file (e.g., MP4, MOV, AVI).

Display: The video appears as a single frame in the UI.

Controls (positioned below the video frame):
Video Slider: Allows navigation between frames by dragging or clicking.

Play Button: Plays the video from the current frame.

Pause Button: Pauses playback at the current frame.
1.2 Object Segmentation
Point-Based Segmentation:
Users click on the video frame to add prompt points (visible as dots) on objects to segment.

Each prompt point triggers the generation of a segmentation mask for the clicked object.

The mask appears only on the current frame, with no tracking until explicitly initiated.
Mask Visualization:
Each object’s mask has a distinct color to differentiate it from other objects.

Masks update only on the current frame when points are added or when switching to a new frame (if no tracking has occurred).
1.3 Object Management
Add New Object:
An "Add New Object" button creates a new object for segmentation.

Each new object generates an object bar, displayed above the "Add New Object" button.
Object Bar Features (per object):
Mute Object: Temporarily hides the segmentation mask for that object (toggleable).

Delete Object: Removes the object and its segmentation entirely.

Clear Object: Clears the segmentation mask for that object without deleting the object itself.
Object Selection:
Users select an object by clicking its object bar.

When adding prompt points, the resulting mask is associated with the currently selected object and uses its unique color.
1.4 Tracking
Track Objects:
A "Track Objects" button initiates tracking for all segmented objects across the entire video.

Tracking propagates masks from the current frame to all other frames.

Once tracking is complete, masks are available and visible on all frames for all objects.
1.5 Mode Switching
Enter FX Mode:
A "FX Mode" button transitions the UI to FX Mode.

The video frame remains visible with all segmentations overlaid.

The state of Segmentation Mode is preserved for returning later.
2. FX Mode
2.1 Object Selection for Effects
Object Buttons:
Each segmented object has a corresponding button.

Clicking an object button selects that object, determining which segmentation the effects will be applied to.

Effects applied to other objects remain visible in the frame, unaffected by the current selection.
2.2 Global Parameters (Per Object)
Purpose: These settings adjust the overall appearance of the selected object’s segmentation and its effects.

Controls:
Mask Opacity: A slider to adjust the opacity of the selected object’s segmentation mask (does not affect effect opacity).

Feathering Controls:
Sliders and input fields for radius, expand, and other relevant feathering parameters.

Values can be positive or negative.

Applies to both the segmentation mask and all effects applied to the object uniformly.
FX Opacity: A slider to adjust the opacity of all effects applied to the selected object (distinct from mask opacity).

Invert FX: A checkbox to apply effects outside the segmentation mask instead of inside.
2.3 FX Stack
Select and Apply Effects:
A "Select Effect" dropdown lists available effects (initially: Blur, Black and White, Chromatic Aberration, Glow).

Clicking an effect and pressing "Apply Effect" adds it to the FX stack for the selected object.
Effect Blocks:
Each applied effect appears as a modular effect block in the FX stack.

Features per block:
Effect name displayed at the top.

Sliders, knobs, and input fields for effect-specific parameters (customized per effect).

Real-time updates: Adjusting parameters instantly updates the effect on the current frame.
Stacking and Ordering:
Effects are applied in the order they appear in the stack.

Users can drag blocks to rearrange the order or press "X" to delete a block.
Effect-Specific Feathering:
Each effect block includes:
Knobs for radius, expand, and opacity (positive/negative values, with keyboard input support).

Invert Mask checkbox.

These controls affect only the specific effect, independent of global feathering settings.
2.4 Presets
Save Preset:
A "Save Preset" button saves the current FX stack (effect blocks, order, and parameter settings) as a preset for the selected object.
Load Preset:
A "Load Preset" button displays a list of saved presets.

Selecting a preset and pressing "Apply" loads its effect blocks and settings into the FX stack, overwriting the current stack.
2.5 Importing Effects
Import Effect:
A button or interface allows users to load new effects easily (e.g., by pasting effect code or dragging files).

Imported effects are added to the "Select Effect" dropdown for future use.
2.6 Rendering and Exporting
Render Effects:
A "Render Effects" button applies all effects and settings to all frames for seamless playback.

Without rendering, effects apply only to the current frame.
Export Options:
Export Mask Video:
Exports one MP4 video per object, showing the raw segmentation mask (white mask on black background).

No feathering is applied; only the original segmentation is exported.

Matches the uploaded video’s frame rate, resolution, and dimensions.

Users can choose the save path.
Export FX Video:
Exports a single MP4 video with all effects applied to all objects, without visible masks.

Includes all feathering and parameter settings as displayed.

Matches the uploaded video’s frame rate, resolution, and dimensions.

If unrendered, rendering occurs automatically before export.

Users can choose the save path.
2.7 Mode Switching
Return to Segmentation Mode:
A "Seg Mode" button switches back to Segmentation Mode, restoring the previous state (video frame, segmentations, and settings intact).
3. Additional Features
Reset All:
A "Reset All" button clears all masks, effects, and settings.

Returns the app to Segmentation Mode with a clean slate.

Unloads any applied effects or segmentations to free up resources.
4. User Interface Layout
Segmentation Mode:
Video frame (clickable for prompt points) in the center.

Object bars stacked above the "Add New Object" button.

Below the video frame: Video slider, Play, and Pause buttons.

Additional buttons: "Track Objects" and "FX Mode".
FX Mode:
Video frame (with segmentations overlaid) in the same position.

Object selection buttons (one per object).

Global Parameters section with sliders and inputs.

FX Stack section with effect blocks and controls.

Buttons: "Save Preset", "Load Preset", "Import Effect", "Render Effects", "Export Mask Video", "Export FX Video", and "Seg Mode".
5. Feature Specifications
Real-Time Updates:
In Segmentation Mode, masks update only on the current frame until tracking is initiated.

In FX Mode, effect parameter changes (global or per effect) update only the current frame until "Render Effects" is pressed.
Effect Persistence:
Effects applied to one object remain visible when switching to another object; only the selected object’s effects are editable.
Initial Effects:
Blur

Black and White

Chromatic Aberration

Glow
MatAnyone API Integration:
Used for segmentation and tracking.

Relies on client-side JavaScript library (per GitHub repo: https://github.com/pq-yang/MatAnyone).

Users provide prompt points to generate first-frame masks, which are tracked across the video.
6. Development Prioritization (Response to Query)
Recommended Focus:
Phase 1: Prioritize Video Upload, Object Segmentation, Tracking, and Exporting (Mask Videos).
Build a functional Segmentation Mode with video display, prompt points, mask generation, object management, tracking, and mask video export.

Ensure the core workflow (upload > segment > track > export) works seamlessly first.
Phase 2: Expand to FX Mode and Effects.
Add the FX Mode UI, object selection, global parameters, FX stack, rendering, and full video export with effects.

Integrate initial effects (Blur, Black and White, Chromatic Aberration, Glow) and preset/import functionality.
Rationale:
Establishing a robust segmentation and tracking foundation ensures the app’s core functionality is reliable before adding effects complexity.

The UI layout (video frame, slider, buttons) can be designed to support both modes from the start, allowing a smooth transition to FX Mode later.
